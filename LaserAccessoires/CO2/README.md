## Tube holders

* Cloudray lasers:
   * C35 (small 35W laser tube). This is designed to be clamped via
     two M4x30 screws inside the holder that should get some kind of
     viton or neoprene coating. The tube itself is not adjustable
     in this mount. The mounts are fixed at 110mm spacing via M4
     screws (this has been designed to be mounted on 20x20MM B-type
     aluminum extrusions with 6mm channel)
