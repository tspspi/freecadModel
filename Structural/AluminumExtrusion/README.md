# Aluminum extrusion templates

Those templates can be used to aid the design process when using Aluminum extrusions

## Type B

### Profiles

| Size | Notch |    |
| --- | --- | --- |

### Edge connector cube

This is a simple edge connector cube for three 20x20 profiles.
Note that the profiles are usually designed for M6 screws but the
DIN912 screw heads are usually 1mm too high for such a cube design
so they have to be grinded down (or smaller screws have to be used).
This design works better for 30x30 or 40x40 profiles without any
special considerations for the screws. M6 screws are used since
most profiles are designed for M6 threads.
