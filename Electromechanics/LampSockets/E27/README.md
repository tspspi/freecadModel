# E27 Lamp Sockets

This directory contains lamp sockets for E27 lamps. Please beware
that you usually cannot print them directly out of PLA or similar material
due to the high thermal load of a lamp in vicinity. Under some circumstances
like low wattage LED lamps it may be possible to use them - but they are
cheap and [readily available](https://amzn.to/3WzRVW5) (note: this is an Amazon affiliate link, this pages author profits from qualified purchases) so it's not worth the hazzle. These models have been created as templates when including
such sockets in other components like lamp posts
