# Housing for electron beam kicker PCB

This is a copper housing for the electron beam kicker
PCB for the Philips XL30 ESEM. It gets attached to the poleshoe
like the BSE detector.

The KiCAD files for the kicker PCB(s) will be published soon

The beam modulator installed at the BSE detector location on
the polepiece of the XL30 ESEM (the Kapton tape has been used due
to other reasons, make very sure the casing is properly grounded and
also make sure that all conductors of the assembly are connected to
ground at all times to provide a discharge path for the electron beam
induced current - else the parts will charge to very high and dangerous
voltages).
