# Vacuum parts

This repository contains some vacuum parts

## Philips XL30 compatible parts

Those parts have been designed to build experiments around
an old Philips XL30 scanning electron microscope. Those designs
are in no way associated with Philips or any manufacturer. Also
there is no guarantee for correctnes

### Blindflange

This is a model for a blind flange on the SEM that acts as template
for custom extensions

### CF35/CF40 adapter

This is an adapter based on the blind flange to attach standard CF35/CF40
feedthroughs and vacuum parts to the flanges. Please keep in mind that
the flanges by the manufacturers are usually designed with radiation
protection, magnetic shielding and high voltage protection in mind - because
of that you are usually not permitted on using custom stuff on machines
that have a service contract. Make sure to check with your manufacturer but
usually they don't like that for reasons ...

### Blindflange 100mm variant

This is a model for a blind flange on the SEM that acts as template
for custom extensions

### Blindflange 120mm variant

This is a model for a blind flange on the SEM that acts as template
for custom extensions (left side below the secondary electron detector)

### CF35/CF40 adapter 100mm variant

Again an adapter based on the 100mm blind flange to attach standard CF34/CF40
components to the 100mm flange on the side of the electron microscope. Make
sure to read the disclaimer above.

### Sample mount adapter M4 to 19mm

This is a simple sample mount adapter that allows one to insert flat and
wide 19mm diameter, 8mm long sample mounts that get fixed with M3 setscrews
from the outside. It gets mounted in the M4 mount hole on top of the
mechanical stage.

Usually such adapters are built out of stainless steel or aluminum. Keep in mind
that it's a bad idea to drill a hole into the bottom of the holder and insert an
M4 threaded rod - it really has to be built _out of a single piece_ on a lathe,
else you will experience major vibrational problems!

### A simple front door alternative

Since we required a front door with custom flanges and mounts - a simple template
for a flat front door as base for further development:

### A simple front door with four CF63 compatible surfaces

This is a model of a front door offering land patterns for four CF63 conflat flanges
without any knife edge on the XL30 side. This allows to attach CF63 flanges with Viton
gaskets.
