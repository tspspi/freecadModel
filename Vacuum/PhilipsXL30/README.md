# Vacuum parts

This repository contains some vacuum parts

## Philips XL30 compatible parts

Those parts have been designed to build experiments around
an old Philips XL30 scanning electron microscope. Those designs
are in no way associated with Philips or any manufacturer. Also
there is no guarantee for correctnes

### Blindflange

This is a model for a blind flange on the SEM that acts as template
for custom extensions

### CF35/CF40 adapter

This is an adapter based on the blind flange to attach standard CF35/CF40
feedthroughs and vacuum parts to the flanges. Please keep in mind that
the flanges by the manufacturers are usually designed with radiation
protection, magnetic shielding and high voltage protection in mind - because
of that you are usually not permitted on using custom stuff on machines
that have a service contract. Make sure to check with your manufacturer but
usually they don't like that for reasons ...

### Blindflange 100mm variant

This is a model for a blind flange on the SEM that acts as template
for custom extensions

### CF35/CF40 adapter 100mm variant

Again an adapter based on the 100mm blind flange to attach standard CF34/CF40
components to the 100mm flange on the side of the electron microscope. Make
sure to read the disclaimer above.
