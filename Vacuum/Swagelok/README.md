# Various Swagelok compatible components

## PTFE Fiber ferrules (1/8 inch)

The PTFE fiber ferrules

* ```FiberFerruleSingle0.125in.FCStd```
* ```FiberFerruleTripple0.125in.FCStd```

are to be manufactured out of PTFE. They can be inserted into
standard 1/8 inch Swagelok flanges or used together with Swagelok
weld flanges to feed through a single or three fibers into a
vacuum environment. This design should work down to UHV (1e-10 mbar)
when manufactured properly. When the Swagelok screw is applied the
PTFE gets compressed onto the fiber mantle.
