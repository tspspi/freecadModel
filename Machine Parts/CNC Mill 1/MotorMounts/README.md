# Motor mounts for small milling machine(s)

## Cross table NEMA17 mount, X sled (```CrossTableMount02.FCStd```)

This is a simple mount for a NEMA17 stepper motor on a small
commercially available cross table. The mount is parameterizeable for different
heighs and base profile spacings via the spreadsheet feature of FreeCAD.

## Cross table NEMA17 mount, Y sled (```CrossTableMount01.FCStd```)

This is a simple mount for a NEMA17 stepper motor on a small
cross table. This mount is parameterizeable for different height
offsets as well as nut spacings on the top slide of the cross table
via FreeCADs spreadsheet feature.
