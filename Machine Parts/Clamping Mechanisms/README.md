# Various clamping mechanisms

## Deep clamping jaws

This is a design for a clamping jaw that can attach directly to
a T-slot profile. Then the clamping jaw itself can be tightened via
two M4 screws onto the workpiece. The jaw itself is held in place
while not clamped by two M3 screws. The M4 screws travel through M4
nuts inserted into the static part so the whole chuck can be machined
out of two aluminum blanks (one 110 x 25 x 20 mm in dimension and the
other at least 100 x 10 x 20mm in dimension).
